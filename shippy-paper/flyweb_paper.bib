@article{Gunes2002,
abstract = {Mobile multi-hop ad-hoc networks promise an ef- ficient and very flexible way of establishing a com- munication connection. One aspect of these kind of networks is their convenience, which is some- times neglected in research. Especially for civil applications, this aspect of ad-hoc networks need more attention. It is expected that users neither need to know much of networks nor perform com- plex configuration tasks to establish a connection. Therefore this kinds of networks have to not only handle a very difficult environment, but also have to be very easy to use. One of the basic requirement of networking is that each node in the network has a unique iden- tification, also called an address. In the internet and in local area networks IP addresses are com- mon. Mobile ad-hoc networks should also use IP addresses thus the devices will be same and also to allow the interconnection of ad-hoc networks to the internet. It is an open question how to provide IP addresses to nodes in mobile multi-hop ad-hoc networks. In this work we introduce a new dynamic IP ad- dress configuration algorithm for mobile multi-hop ad-hoc networks. Further we show through simu- lation results, made with ns-2, the performance of the proposed addressing algorithm and compare it with other approaches.},

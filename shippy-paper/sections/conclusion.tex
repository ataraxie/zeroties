\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

As networking capabilities become more ubiquitous across different types of devices, applications that communicate over local area networks are becoming more common in recent years.
Using a proper suite of networking protocols and technologies, these applications can easily discover other devices in the network and exchange data with them.
One appealing way to build such apps is using Zeroconf networks and Web browsers.
Nonetheless, applications operating in Zeroconf still face the common challenges imposed by the type of network that they operate on, e.g. unstable wireless links and host mobility. 
Also, Web developers have little to no browser API support for these technologies.

To address the aforementioned issues, we proposed \APINameNoSpace, a JavaScript framework for Zeroconf Web applications that abstracts and decouples networking logic from application logic and seamlessly integrates fault-tolerance to applications that require state but face failures due to intermittent connectivity. We evaluated \APIName by measuring network traffic and state recovery in the face of failures using proof-of-concept applications. \APIName supports all its intended use cases and future work will improve bottlenecks and performance problems identified during our evaluation. The first presentation we held for \APIName was promising indeed: it was itself the first live example of a \APIshort application.

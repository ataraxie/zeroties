Our goal is to provide a framework to build Zeroconf Web applications and expose an easy-to-use API to application developers. 
We aim to provide fault-tolerance seamlessly without the developer having to deal with the underlying details of state replication and consistency challenges. 
We implemented our approach as a JavaScript library and describe it in the following sections.
We first cover a few necessary assumptions to make this implementation tractable and then explain our exposed API. 
We then continue with a more detailed conceptual description and our replication strategy and consistency guarantees.
Finally, we elaborate on what failure scenarios are handled by our approach.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:motivating_example}





Our aim is to build upon the appealing features of zeroconf networks by making them fault tolerant.
This property is desirable in any scenario where network services need to remain stable even when the server node disconnects.
In the zeroconf setting, we anticipate that the hassle-free set-up will be complemented naturally by a system that enables a service to be provided in uninterrupted fashion, even when the server node disconnects.

We think that the idea of hosting an ad-hoc network from within a Web application in the browser has great potential, and we think that applications for this network can benefit from graceful recovery upon disconnection of local servers.

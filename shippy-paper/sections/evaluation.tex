\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

In this section we evaluate the efficiency of ~\APIName in detecting server failures and in subsequent recovery (Section~\ref{sub:eval:server-recovery}).
We then evaluate the time it takes for a new client to fully join a running~\APIName app, i.e. to establish a WebSocket connection to the running server and receive the server state with the \texttt{successors} list (Section~\ref{sub:eval:connection}).
Finally, we measure package traffic at the devices connected with a~\APIName app (Section~\ref{sub:eval:traffic}).

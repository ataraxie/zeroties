As networking capabilities become more ubiquitous across different types of devices, applications that communicate over local area networks are becoming increasingly common.
This trend has been accelerated by the adoption of zero-configuration (zeroconf) networking standards that eliminate the burden of setup procedures.
Applications operating in zeroconf settings often face the challenge of maintaining reliability and consistency in the face of wireless links and mobile devices, resulting in potentially intermittent connectivity between hosts.
Fault-tolerance is thus a desirable property for such applications, but it can be difficult to achieve in practice.
To this end, we introduce Successorships, a JavaScript library that provides the appealing qualities of zeroconf enriched with fault-tolerance, to applications running in the browser.
Our library enables graceful recovery after server failure by handing over the server role to one of the clients currently in the network.
We evaluate our approach with a sample application, focusing on usage scenarios that involve interactions between users walking in and out of a single room. 
We find that our library recovers from failures gracefully after an average of 3.5 seconds, and that application state is maintained with eventual consistency.

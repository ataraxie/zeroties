\subsection{In-Browser Web Servers}
\label{sub:background_in_browser_web_servers}

More recently, a number of technologies have emerged to enable Web servers to be deployed entirely from within Web browsers.
Such technologies have the appeal that they simplify the process of serving Web content, thus potentially expanding the breadth of users capable of doing so.
For example, Opera Unite\footnote{\url{http://help.opera.com/Windows/12.10/en/unite.html}}, Web Server Chrome\footnote{\url{https://github.com/kzahel/web-server-chrome}}, PeerServer\footnote{\url{http://www.peer-server.com/}}, and FlyWeb\footnote{\url{http://flyweb.github.io/}} all enable browser applications to publish fully functioning Web servers.
We discuss FlyWeb below, and defer details on a few other approaches to Section \ref{sec:related_work}.

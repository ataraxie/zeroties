\subsection{Sample Successorships Application}

In our previous project, we created a web application using the presentation framework \textit{Reveal.js}~\footnote{https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/, accessed 2019-04-17} to present Successorships to graduate students of the computer science department of the University of British Columbia.
The application used the Successorships API that made use of the Zeroconf protocols based on FlyWeb.
Obviously, the presenters had to have a Mac computer and a dedicated old version of Firefox Developer Edition with the FlyWeb addon installed to be able to present.
Moreover, the previously mentioned performance problems were clearly visible, with recovery of the system from intentionally injected faults taking over 20 seconds at times.
In a similar fashion, we presented Zeroties to an audience of graduate students at the same university.
The presentation technicalities remained the same, except that the API usage within Successorships was changed from FlyWeb to Zeroties.
To demonstrate this new independence of Firefox, the presentation was performed on Google Chrome.
A significant decrease in time-to-recovery could also clearly be observed.

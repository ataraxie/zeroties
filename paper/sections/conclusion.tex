\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented Zeroties, an asynchronous publish-subscribe service for web applications operating in local ad-hoc networks. 
Our evaluation has shown that Zeroties makes our previously developed framework Successorships available on a variety of browsers and speeds up failure recovery by almost a factor of 10.
While we can still see lots of potential for improvement in terms of robustness, scalability, and expressiveness, we think that we are now one large step closer to such applications becoming reality.
With Zeroties, we hope to contribute to more leveraging of local network infrastructure and a decrease in overall Internet communication because we think that physical and geological location have not been taken into account enough in the recent developments of the Internet.
